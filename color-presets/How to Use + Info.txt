HOW TO IMPLEMENT THE COLORS:

It's super simple.

Once you have Tacky Borders open it'll go to your system tray (the arrow on the bottom right of your taskbar)

Right click on the icon in the tray > Show Config 

Recommend to place the files from this github repo in there so it's all in one place

Pick a color preferance 

Open the file with notepad 

Ctrl + A to select all contents, then copy it all

Open the legit config file in the folder that came up when you clicked Show Config

Ctrl + A to select all contents, then paste/replace the contents with your color preferance

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

INFO:

- If you just copy a config file from the variations and then 
  replace the legit one with it while Tacky Borders is running it will error so its best to do it this way.

- If you want to customize more colors to your liking, it's as simple as changing the color hex codes in the config files 
  They look like this ( #301A82 ) and a great website for it is https://coolors.co/df1a7c-29e3ab-225de9-d81027-301a82

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your Tacky Borders doesn't auto run on PC startup:

Create a shortcut for the Tacky Borders.exe 

Press Win + R 

Type shell:startup

Paste the .exe shortcut there

If you move the .exe to another location you'll have to reset the shortcut you put in shell:startup
