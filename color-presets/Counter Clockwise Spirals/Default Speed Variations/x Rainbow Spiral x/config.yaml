# rendering_backend: Type of renderer. Supported values:
#   - V2: A more complex, feature-rich renderer. Available in v1.2.0 and above.
#   - Legacy: A simpler, more limited renderer. Available in v0.1.0 and above.
#
# NOTE: Performance between the two may vary system-to-system. Choose whichever works best.

# Global configuration options
global:
  # border_width: Width of the border (in pixels)
  # Reduced slightly to help prevent bleed on multi-monitor setups
  border_width: 2

  # border_offset: Offset of the border from the window edges (in pixels)
  #   - Negative values shrink the border inwards
  #   - Positive values expand the border outwards
  # Increased negative offset to prevent border bleed on monitor edges and fullscreen windows
  border_offset: -2

  # border-radius: Radius of the border's corners. Supported values:
  #   - Auto: Automatically determine the radius
  #   - Square: Sharp corners (radius = 0)
  #   - Round: Fully rounded corners
  #   - RoundSmall: Slightly rounded corners
  #   - Or specify any numeric value for a custom radius
  border_radius: Auto

  # border_z_order: Z-order of the border relative to its window. Supported values:
  #   - AboveWindow: Place the border above its window
  #   - BelowWindow: Place the border below its window
  #
  # NOTE: Using 'AboveWindow' may cause the border to flicker when used with some applications
  # that manipulate window layering, leading to z-order conflicts.
  border_z_order: AboveWindow

  # follow_native_border: Follow Windows' behavior for border visibility.
  #
  # Windows already shows or hides native borders depending on a window's type or state
  # (e.g., they're hidden for borderless fullscreen windows). When enabled, this option makes
  # tacky-borders follow that visibility behavior.
  #
  # NOTE: This setting only affects visibility for borders that have been initialized.
  # To make sure a border is initialized in the first place, use window_rules.
  follow_native_border: False

  # initialize_delay: Time (in ms) before the border appears after opening a new window
  # unminimize_delay: Time (in ms) before the border appears after unminimizing a window
  #
  # These settings help accommodate window animations (e.g., open or unminimize animations).
  # Set these to 0 if window animations are disabled.
  #
  # These can also be used to accommodate border animations (e.g., fade animations).

  # active_color: the color of the active window's border
  # inactive_color: the color of the inactive window's border

  #   - Gradient: Define colors and direction
