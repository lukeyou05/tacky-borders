global:
  # border_width: the width of the border in pixels
  border_width: 3

  # border_offset: how many pixels to adjust the size/position of the border by relative to the window
  border_offset: -1

  # border-radius: the radius of the corners.
  # Leave it at -1 to let tacky-borders handle the radius, or set your own custom value.
  border_radius: -1

  # active_color: the color of the active window's border
  # inactive_color: the color of the inactive window's border
  #
  # Two types of colors are supported: solid and gradient.
  #   Gradient colors support hex codes.
  #   Solid colors support both a hex code and "accent".
  #
  # SOLID EXAMPLE:
  #   active_color: "#ffffff"
  #
  #   OR
  #
  #   active_color: "accent"
  #
  # GRADIENT EXAMPLE:
  #   active_color:
  #     colors: ["#000000", "#ffffff"]
  #     direction: 45deg
  #
  #   OR
  #
  #   active_color:
  #     colors: ["#000000", "#ffffff"]
  #     direction:
  #       start: [0.0, 1.0]
  #       end: [1.0, 0.0]
  #
  #   Note: [0.0, 0.0] is the top left corner
  #         [1.0, 1.0] is the bottom right corner
  active_color:
    colors: ["#6274e7", "#8752a3"]
    direction: 45deg

  inactive_color:
    colors: ["#30304f", "#363c69"]
    direction:
      start: [0.0, 1.0]
      end: [1.0, 0.0]

  # intialize_delay: the time (in milliseconds) it takes for the border to show after a window is opened.
  # unminimize_delay: the time (in milliseconds) it takes for the border to show after a window is unminimized.
  #
  # There is no easy way to deal with window animations (such as when a window is opened or unminimized), and these
  # delays are here to help account for that. If you have window animations disabled, I recommend setting these to 0.
  #
  # These can also be adjusted to account for things like fade animations, which take additional time.
  initialize_delay: 200
  unminimize_delay: 150

  # animations:
  #   active: adjusts the active window's animations
  #   inactive: adjusts the inactive window's animations
  #   fps: adjusts the animation fps
  #
  #   Currently, three types of animations are supported:
  #     Spiral,
  #     ReverseSpiral,
  #     Fade,
  #
  #   The animation types can be adjusted by specifying their name like follows:
  #     active: { Spiral, Fade }
  #
  #   The animation parameters can be adjusted by appending them to the animation type like follows:
  #     active: { Spiral: { duration: 1800, easing: Linear }, Fade: { duration: 300, easing: EaseInOutQuad } }
  #
  #   Note: spiral animations can be taxing on the CPU and GPU on low-end systems.
  animations:
    active: { ReverseSpiral, Fade: { easing: EaseInOutQuad } }
    inactive: { Spiral, Fade: { easing: EaseInOutQuad } }
    fps: 60

  #   name: "MozillaWindowClass"   # Name of the class or title
  #   strategy: "Equals"           # Optional. Currently supports "Equals", "Contains", or "Regex". Defaults to "Equals"
  #   enabled: true                # Optional. Enables/disables the border. Defaults to true. Note: you can't forcibly enable borders
  #
  # Any option in the global config can also be defined in window_rules.
  # If something isn't defined here, it will default to global config options.
